# ScratchCanTalk
Are you a bit disappointed that the Scratch 'Say'-block doesn't actually say anything? This extension introduces an additional 'Say' block that uses text-to-speech! 
Windows only...

##Step 1 - Make sure .Net framework 4.5.1 is installed
Installed by default on Windows 8.1 and higher. If needed, it can be installed from http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=40779

##Step 2 - Run the Scratch helper application
Build the Scratch helper application (Visual studio 2015) or run the binary 'sct.exe' that can be found in the bin folder. 

##Step 3 - Testing 1,2!
1. Turn on your speakers
2. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:15003/speak/hello/girl

##Step 4 - Import blocks in Scratch
This only works in the offline Scratch editor (https://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/).

1. Hold the shift-key and click the 'File' menu;
2. Click 'Import experimental HTTP extension';
3. Import the file 'ScratchCanTalk Extension.s2e';
4. In the 'More blocks' section a sub-section 'ScratchCanTalk' should appear. A green light should indicate a successful connection with the helper application;
5. the block should be self-explaining :-)


Have fun!
